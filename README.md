This repo is non-inlined e-mail templates for Mandrill. That means they will not work out of the box. 

To change a template for production use:
1. run the HTML through the mailchimp inliner: http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/
2. paste that into the same template
3. If you're just testing, USE A DIFFERENT TEMPLATE THAN PRODUCTION

That is all.
